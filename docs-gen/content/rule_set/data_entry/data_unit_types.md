## Introduction to Data Unit Types in VSS

It is in VSS possible for signals to specify a unit of measurement from a list of predefined data unit types.
For most signals in the VSS standard catalog, a data unit type has been selected. A typical example is `Vehicle.Speed`, as shown below.

```
Vehicle.Speed:
  datatype: float
  type: sensor
  unit: km/h
  description: Vehicle speed.
```

The ambition when selecting data unit types for signals in VSS standard catalog has been to use either a unit based on SI-units,
or a unit commonly used within the vehicle industry. For the `Vehicle.Speed` example above this means that `km/h` has been selected,
even if `m/s` from an SI-perspective would have been a better choice.

It must be noted that the selected unit does not imply that the value of `Vehicle.Speed` always needs to be sent or visualized
as `km/h` (with float as datatype). A user interface or API may show or request vehicle speed in any unit it likes,
and a transport protocol may send speed in another unit, possibly also involving scaling and offset.
But in protocols not explicitly specifying data unit types (like [VISS](https://raw.githack.com/w3c/automotive/gh-pages/spec/VISSv2_Core.html))
it is expected that `Vehicle.Speed` is sent and received as `km/h` (without scaling or offset).

In some cases it is natural to omit the data unit type. This concerns typically signals where data type `string` is used,
but also signals where the value just represents a number, like in the example below:

```
Vehicle.Cabin.DoorCount:
  datatype: uint8
  type: attribute
  default: 4
  description: Number of doors in vehicle.
```
### Logical Data Unit Types

VSS supports `percent` as data unit type, typically with 0 to 100% as the allowed range.
In some cases, the definition on how to calculate the signal value is obvious, like for `Vehicle.Powertrain.FuelSystem.Level`
below. It is likely that all VSS users will calculate fuel level in the same way, i.e. the meaning of a fuel level of 50%
is well agreed, the liters of fuel in the tank is exactly 50% of nominal capacity.

```
Vehicle.Powertrain.FuelSystem.Level:
  datatype: uint8
  type: sensor
  unit: percent
  min: 0
  max: 100
  description: Level in fuel tank as percent of capacity. 0 = empty. 100 = full.

```

In other cases, the formula for calculating the signal is not obvious and is not specified in VSS. A typical example is shown below for clutch wear.
While most VSS users likely can agree that a brand new clutch shall have 0 as "ClutchWear",
the exact formula for calculating clutch wear for a used clutch will likely be vehicle specific.
Some vehicles might monitor actual wear, others might estimate it based on vehicle usage.
This is in VSS called a logical range, a VSS user knows what range to use but are free to define the formula for calculating the value.
Values from different vehicles (of different make/model) can not always be compared, as the formula used for calculation may differ.

```
Vehicle.Powertrain.Transmission.ClutchWear:
  datatype: uint8
  type: sensor
  unit: percent
  max: 100
  description: Clutch wear as percent. 0 = no wear. 100 = worn.
```

VSS tooling use the list specified in [config.yaml](https://github.com/COVESA/vss-tools/blob/master/vspec/config.yaml) to validate that only supported types are used in the signal specification.
